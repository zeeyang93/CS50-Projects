            <p> Quote from Wiki:</p>

            <blockquote style='color:gray' >
                <p>The Queen's Gambit is a 2020 American coming-of-age period drama miniseries based on Walter Tevis's 1983 novel of the same name. The title refers to "Queen's Gambit", a chess opening. It was written and directed by Scott Frank, who created it with Allan Scott. Beginning in the mid-1950s and proceeding into the 1960s, the story follows the life of Beth Harmon (Anya Taylor-Joy), an orphaned chess prodigy on her rise to the top of the chess world while struggling with drug and alcohol dependency.</p>

                <p>Netflix released The Queen's Gambit on October 23, 2020. After four weeks it had become Netflix's most-watched scripted miniseries.[1] It was acclaimed by critics, who lauded Taylor-Joy's performance as well as the cinematography and production values. It has also received a positive response from the chess community, and data suggests that it has increased public interest in the game.[2][3]</p>

                <p>The series won two Golden Globe Awards: Best Limited Series or Television Film and Best Actress â€“ Miniseries or Television Film for Taylor-Joy. She also won the Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Movie/Miniseries and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie.</p>
